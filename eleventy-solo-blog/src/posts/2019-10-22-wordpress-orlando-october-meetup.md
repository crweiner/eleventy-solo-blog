# Want to learn about Git, GitHub, and how they fit into your WordPress world?

Hello WordPress People! Let's talk about Git, GitHub, and the wonderful word of WordPress.

I'm honored to be presenting a talk at the WordPress Orlando October Meetup titled *Hacktoberfest 2019: Git, GitHub, and WordPress*.

This talk covers the very basics of Git and GitHub as well as dives into how WordPress developers can use these tools to improve their workflow and start helping out open-source projects, such as the many that are WordPress related!
