  <p>My name is Chandler Weiner and I'm a jack of all trades.</p>
  
  <p>I am a biologist by day, WordPress web designer by night, and traveler by the weekend.</p>

  <p>While this site is a static <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> blog, my first love is WordPress and all that it has to offer! I enjoy talking about WordPress in the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/orlando-wordpress-meetup/" target="_blank">Orlando WordPress Meetup</a> group and shared my WordPress journey on <a href="https://wpcoffeetalk.com/" target="_blank">WP Coffee Talk</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're in the market for an incredible WordPress website where someone can obsess over it as much as you do, then check out my business at <a href="https://obsessivewp.com/" target="_blank">ObsessiveWP</a>.</p>

  <p>My <a href="https://github.com/crweiner/" target="_blank">GitHub profile is available here</a> for all of my projects and my tweets on WordPress, Hacktoberfest, science, and travel are at <a href="https://twitter.com/c_dubbs" target="_blank">@C_Dubbs</a>.</p>

  <p>Are you in the mood to learn how to travel for free? I've been lucky to travel the world for next-to-nothing thanks to points and miles. Want to join me? Learn how at <a href="https://infrequentflyer.blog/" target="_blank">The Infrequent Flyer Blog</a>.</p>
