# I got to be a guest on the WP Coffee Talk podcast!

I was honored to be a guest on [Michelle Frechette's WP Coffee Talk](https://wpcoffeetalk.com/)! We had an amazing talk about my journey in the WordPress community, my agency ObsessiveWP, and how I juggle my personal life with my WordPress life.
