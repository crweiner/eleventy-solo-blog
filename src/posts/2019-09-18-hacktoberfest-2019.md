# Let's Get Ready For Open-Source Love And Swag!

Are you aware of the wonderful holiday of Hacktoberfest? It's the most swag-filled time of the year!

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is an annual celebration of open-source code sponsored each year by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and other companies during the month of October (for 2019 it's [Dev.to](https://dev.to) that's the official cosponsor). By submitting 4 pull requests on any GitHub repository, you will get a t-shirt absolutely free!

It is a wonderful way to encourage new people to commit to open-source projects and foster greater community development!

Want to know where you can find out all of the companies offering swag for Hacktoberfest?

Look no further than [HacktoberfestSwagList.com](https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/)!

What is the Hacktoberfest Swag List? It's a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list) run by yours truly that seeks to list in the simplest way possible all of the companies offering swag for Hacktoberfest.

If you (yes, you dear reader!) contribute to the Hacktoberfest Swag List by submitting a pull request, your contribution will go towards earning your official Hacktoberfest t-shirt! And while you're at it, take a look at the list and see what other swag you can earn!

Contributing to the list is very simple and can be done entirely on GitHub without installing any tools or programs. Just [follow these rules](https://github.com/crweiner/hacktoberfest-swag-list/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), open a pull request to merge your contribution to the official list, and I'll let you know if things are looking good.

Be well and happy Hacktoberfest everyone! See you in October!
